    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Once Upon a Time in America (Italian: C'era una volta in America)</b> is a 1984
        epic
        crime film co-written and directed by Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone, and starring Robert De Niro and James
        Woods. The film is an Italian–American venture produced by The Ladd Company, Embassy International Pictures,
        PSO Enterprises and Rafran Cinematografica, and distributed by Warner Bros. Based on Harry Grey's novel The
        Hoods, it chronicles the lives of best friends David "Noodles" Aaronson and Maximilian "Max" Bercovicz as they
        lead a group of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence as Jewish gangsters in New York City's world of
        organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, and
        broken relationships, together with the rise of mobsters in American society.

        It was the final film directed by Leone before his death five years later, and the first feature film he had
        directed in 13 years. It is also the third installment of Leone's Once Upon a Time Trilogy, which includes Once
        Upon a Time in the West (1968) and Duck, You Sucker! (1971). The cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli,
        and the film score by Ennio Morricone. Leone originally envisaged two three-hour films, then a single 269-minute
        (4 hours and 29 minutes) version, but was convinced by distributors to shorten it to 229 minutes (3 hours and 49
        minutes). The American distributors, The Ladd Company, further shortened it to 139 minutes (2 hours and 19
        minutes), and rearranged the scenes into chronological order, without Leone's involvement.

        The US edit was a critical and commercial flop in the United States, and critics who had seen both versions
        harshly condemned the changes made. The original "European cut" has remained a critical favourite and frequently
        appears in lists of the greatest films of all time, especially in the gangster genre.</p><br>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">In the 1930s, three thugs search for a man named "Noodles". Noodles is drugging
        himself in an opium den with a newspaper next to him featuring the death of bootleggers Patrick Goldberg, Philip
        Stein and Maximilian Bercovicz. He recalls the police removing their corpses, one burnt beyond recognition.
        Noodles evades capture and leaves the city.

        In the 1920s, David "Noodles" Aaronson leads a gang of him and his three friends "Patsy" Goldberg, "Cockeye"
        Stein and Dominic, performing jobs for local gangster Bugsy. They meet Max as he foils one of their robberies
        but has the booty stolen from him by corrupt police officer Whitey. Max joins their gang and they later
        blackmail Whitey and get the same police protection as Bugsy.

        The gang becomes successful liquor smugglers. They deposit their earnings in a locker, giving the key to a
        friend of theirs, Moe. Noodles is in love with Moe's sister, Deborah, who dreams of becoming a dancer. Due to
        his socialization as a gangster, Deborah sees no future for their love. Bugsy, now a rival, ambushes the gang
        and fatally shoots Dominic. Noodles kills Bugsy and is sentenced to prison.

        Upon his release a decade later, Noodles rejoins his gang. During a diamond heist they use jewellery employee
        Carol as their informant. She goads Noodles into hitting her, after which he rapes her; she later becomes Max's
        girlfriend. Noodles realizes that the heist was commissioned by a syndicate figure to eliminate competition.
        This leads to tensions between Max and Noodles, who seeks independence. The gang provides protection for
        Teamsters' union boss O'Donnell, during the course of which they exchange newborns at a clinic, punishing the
        head of the police whose wife has just given birth to a boy at that clinic. This results in the police
        withdrawing their actions against striking workers.

        Noodles takes Deborah on a lavish date. When she reveals her plans to pursue a career in Hollywood, he snaps and
        rapes her. As she departs the next day, he attempts to catch a glance of her sitting on the train, but she
        avoids eye contact.

        The repeal of Prohibition forces the gang to look for alternative activities. Max suggests a New York Federal
        Reserve Bank heist, which Noodles and Carol deem too risky. Carol convinces Noodles to inform the police about a
        lesser offense, hoping brief incarceration will cool off Max's ambition. After Noodles calls the police, Max
        knocks him out. Upon regaining consciousness, Noodles learns that Max, Patsy, and Cockeye have been killed by
        the police during the heist, as established at the beginning of the film. A guilt-ridden Noodles hides in the
        opium den. During his subsequent escape, he realizes the locker money has disappeared.

        In the 1960s, Noodles returns to Manhattan for the first time since the 1930s after receiving a letter
        indicating that his identity has been uncovered, seeking to find out who is responsible. He learns that the
        bodies of his three friends have been relocated to Riverdale. He visits their mausoleum in Riverdale and finds a
        key to a railway locker.

        The locker reveals a suitcase full of money, stated to be the advance on his next job. Noodles learns of the
        corruption scandals around Senator Christopher Bailey and visits Carol in a retirement home run by the Bailey
        Foundation. She tells him that Max manipulated them into tipping him off to the police and that Max opened fire
        first, wishing to die young. Noodles spots Deborah in a memorial photograph, who has become a major actress, and
        starts to suspect a connection between Deborah and Bailey. He tracks down Deborah and visits her, telling her
        about his invitation to a party at Bailey's mansion and challenging her to tell him about the mysterious job as
        well as the identity of Bailey. Deborah admits to being Bailey's lover and begs Noodles to leave the city before
        facing hurtful revelations. Ignoring her advice, Noodles leaves her after seeing Bailey's son, who looks like
        the young Max.

        Noodles meets Bailey, who turns out to be Max. Having faked his death, Max stole the gang's money and reinvented
        himself as a self-made business man. He also made Deborah his mistress, thus robbing Noodles of everything he
        had. Faced with ruin due to the corruption scandal, Max reveals that he is behind the mysterious job, which is
        for Noodles to kill him. Noodles refuses. As Noodles leaves the estate, a garbage truck passes and a man,
        presumably Max, walks toward Noodles until the truck passes between them. Noodles sees the truck's auger
        conveyor grinding garbage, but the man is nowhere to be seen.</p>

    <h3 id="Interpretations"><b>Interpretations</b></h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As the film begins and ends in 1933, with Noodles hiding in an opium den from
        syndicate hitmen, and the last shot of the film is of Noodles in a smiling, opium-soaked high, the film can be
        interpreted as having been a drug-induced dream, with Noodles remembering his past and envisioning the future.
        In an interview by Noël Simsolo published in 1987, Leone lent support to this interpretation, saying that the
        scenes set in the 1960s could be seen as an opium dream of Noodles'. In the DVD commentary for the film, film
        historian and critic Richard Schickel states that opium users often report vivid dreams, and that these visions
        have a tendency to explore the user's past and future.

        The ending in which Max appears as Noodles is leaving Bailey's mansion and then suddenly disappears behind a
        truck only for Noodles to see the blades of the truck spinning, was reportedly left ambiguous on purpose. James
        Woods, who played Max, stated that he does not know if Max jumped in the truck or just disappeared. Critic Carlo
        Affatigato described this twist as a "paradox", postulating that the whole film is about how Noodles spends the
        second half of his life seeking out the truth of what happened, only to discover it, not accept it, and not
        investigate what happens to Max in the end. Noodles only wants to believe the reality he has created for
        himself, not an objective one. Affatigato also believes this could point to it all being the imagination of
        Noodles.

        Many people (including Schickel) assume that the 1968 Frisbee scene, which has an immediate cut and gives no
        further resolution, was part of a longer sequence. Ebert stated that the purpose of the flying disc scene was to
        establish the 1960s time frame and nothing more.</p>
