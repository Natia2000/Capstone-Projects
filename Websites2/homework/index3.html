    <h2 id="What is attachment theory?">What is attachment theory?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There is a long list of scientific literature that categorizes how we form emotional
        attachments to our primary caregivers in order to ensure our safety and survival.

        The most famous study comes from a 1969 experiment called the Strange Situation, which gave rise to the four
        styles of attachment we know today. In the study, babies and their birthing parent played in a room together.
        The parent left and then returned a few minutes later. The baby’s reaction was then monitored.

        From that study, the four attachment styles were identified:

        Secure attachment: Babies became upset when their parent left and were comforted by their return.
        Anxious attachment: Babies would become very upset when their parent left and would be difficult to comfort upon
        their return.
        Avoidant attachment: Babies would barely react — or not react at all — when their parent left or returned.
        Disorganized attachment: Babies had more erratic or incoherent reactions to their parent leaving or returning,
        such as hitting their heads on the ground or “freezing up.”
        The baby’s reaction to their parent’s departure and return says a lot about how the baby is used to their
        caregiver attending to their needs, Dr. Derrig notes. And those experiences as youngsters are likely to affect
        the way they relate to others in their adult lives.

        Babies who are securely attached understand their parent is someone they rely on, so they become concerned when
        they go and are comforted by them coming back. On the other hand, babies who learned that their parents aren’t
        going to be attentive to their needs are less worried about their absence and less comforted by their return.
        They’ve learned they can’t rely on their caregivers to provide them with what they need, so the parent’s
        presence (or absence) isn’t as meaningful to them.</p><br>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are four styles that grew out of the Strange Situation experiment. One is
        secure attachment. The other three — anxious, avoidant and disorganized — are considered insecure attachment
        styles.

        Each style exists on a spectrum, so you may not find yourself identifying completely with any one style. Or your
        style may fall into one category but be more or less extreme in how it affects the quality of your
        relationships.

        Dr. Derrig breaks down the four attachment styles and how they can impact your romantic relationships as an
        adult.</p>

    <h3 id="Secure attachment style"><b>Secure attachment style</b></h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Secure attachment is what we all strive for. Babies who form secure attachments to
        their primary caregiver are more likely to become adults who confidently seek out healthy relationships with
        others and are reliable and loving partners themselves, Dr. Derrig says.

        How does it form? Babies form secure attachments when their caregivers consistently fulfill a baby’s physical
        and emotional needs. Babies who are securely attached prefer their primary caregiver over other people and are
        calmed by their presence.

        What does it look like in adult relationships? People with a secure attachment style are more readily able to
        form long-lasting and healthy relationships with others. They’re more likely to trust their partner and be
        emotionally available to them.


        How common is it? Studies show that about 58% of adults are securely attached.

        Tip for people with a secure attachment style: Dr. Derrig says that a secure attachment style doesn’t mean you
        can take for granted that your relationships will be smooth sailing. “If two securely attached people are in a
        relationship, they’re starting out from a better position, but relationships take work for everyone, no matter
        your attachment style,” she says.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Also known as preoccupied attachment or anxious-ambivalent attachment.

        An anxious attachment style is a form of insecure attachment that forms between a baby and an inconsistent
        caregiver. From their perspective, the baby can’t be sure when and if their parent is going to be emotionally
        and physically available to them.

        How does it form? Babies whose primary caregivers aren’t consistent in meeting a baby’s needs are more likely to
        form an anxious attachment. Anxiously attached babies learn that they may or may not get the attention they
        need, so they aren’t easily comforted by their caregivers.

        What does it look like in adult relationships? A partner with an anxious attachment style may be seen as
        “clingy,” “needy” or not trusting. People with an anxious attachment style can be consumed with concern that
        their loved ones will abandon them, and they may seek constant reassurance that they’re safe in their
        relationship.

        How common is it? Research indicates that about 19% of adults have an anxious attachment style.

        Tip for people with an anxious attachment style: Dr. Derrig warns that people who have an anxious attachment can
        drive away their partner with their neediness. That can create even more feelings of insecurity in future
        relationships.

        “People with an anxious attachment can benefit from what we call ‘rituals of separation,’ where the partners
        agree that before they go out for the day, they give each other a kiss. They say, ‘I’ll see you tonight.’ They
        send a text during the day to say they’re thinking of each other. Whatever it is, they make a conscious effort
        to acknowledge that they’re leaving and also that they will be back,” Dr. Derrig explains. “That can help a
        person with an anxious attachment to feel confident their partner will not abandon them.”</p>

    <h3 id="Avoidant attachment style">Avoidant attachmant style</h3>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Also known asdismissive attachment or anxious-avoidant attachment.

        Avoidant attachment can look like an adult who is a “lone wolf” or overly self-sufficient. People with an
        avoidant attachment style are likely to not delve much into emotional conversations, either in regard to their
        own feelings or those of others. An avoidant attachment style often stems from a relationship between a primary
        caregiver and a baby that’s marked by a lack of emotional support or connection.

        How does it form? Avoidant attachment is most likely to form when a caregiver doesn’t provide a baby with
        sufficient emotional support. The caregiver’s responsiveness to the baby most likely ends with caring for their
        physical needs, like feeding and bathing, but the caregiver doesn’t provide the emotional comfort the baby also
        needs. In that environment, the baby learns not to rely on others to care for their emotional needs.

        What does it look like in adult relationships? Adults with an avoidant attachment style can be seen as
        self-reliant and emotionally guarded. They’re unlikely to seek emotional comfort or understand how to comfort
        their partner.

        How common is it? Research shows about 23% of adults have an avoidant attachment style.

        Tip for people with an avoidant attachment style: Dr. Derrig notes that people with an avoidant attachment style
        often distance themselves from others and assume others will disappoint them. Actively observing your own
        emotions and considering how you pull away from others will require a lot of work. But that effort can be an
        eye-opening way to help understand your style and learn to let others in.</p>

    <h3 id="Disorganized attachment style">Disorganized attachment style</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Also known asfearful-avoidant attachment.

        Disorganized attachment is the most extreme and least common style. People with disorganized attachment can be
        seen to act irrationally and be unpredictable or intense in their relationships.

        How does it form? Disorganized attachment often forms through a particularly tumultuous childhood — often one
        that may be marked by fear or trauma. It typically stems from an erratic or incoherent relationship with the
        baby’s primary caregiver.

        What does it look like in adult relationships? Adults with disorganized attachments are likely to live with
        mental health disorders or personality disorders that prevent them from developing healthy relationships with
        others. They’re likely to crave close relationships but push others away when they show them attention.

        Tip for people with an avoidant attachment style: Dr. Derrig says some people who have a disorganized attachment
        style can often benefit from dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), a type of talk therapy that’s especially
        helpful for people who experience very intense emotions.</p>
