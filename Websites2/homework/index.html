    <h2 id="About Football">About Football</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Football</b> is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking
        a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most
        popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in
        Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules
        football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian
        football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football. These various forms of
        football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes".

        There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different
        parts of the world.Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at
        English public schools during the 19th century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football. The expansion and
        cultural power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence
        outside the directly controlled empire. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already
        developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football
        games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was founded in England, becoming the
        first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of
        football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.</p><br>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into
        two main classes of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football,
        rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown,
        and kicking codes such as association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the
        feet, and where handling is strictly limited.

        Common rules among the sports include:

        Two teams usually have between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per
        team) are also popular.
        A clearly defined area in which to play the game.
        Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area,
        or over a line.
        Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts.
        The goal or line being defended by the opposing team.
        Players using only their body to move the ball, i.e. no additional equipment such as bats or sticks.
        In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking. In most codes,
        there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either
        under or over a crossbar between the goalposts.</p>

    <h3 id="Etimology"><b>Etimology</b></h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football". It is
        widely assumed that the word "football" (or the phrase "foot ball") refers to the action of the foot kicking a
        ball. There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in
        medieval Europe that were played on foot.There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.</p>
